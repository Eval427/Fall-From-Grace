#I can't believe I'm actually writing another mod with even more ambitions than the first. Here we go...
#Initial concepts which I am 100% sure will change:
    # Adine almost kills herself
    # Help her recover
#Perfect, let's write 100k+ words.

#Lawyer wyvern = Adine mom

#Concepts for activities:
    #More magazines
    #Rock skipping
    #Hike
    #Some sort of crafts?
    #Probably discussions of Adine's interests and beliefs
    #Something
    #Mess around with the idea of Adine being a human fanfic writer

#Cool idea: You actually have 2 options for the Anna thing with Adine: Tell Adine why Anna is willing to pay for her hospital bills or not.
#If you do, Adine is concerned and angry. You have to comfort her otherwise she will reject the funds maybe?
#If you don't she will become extremely angry that you don't trust her enough, and this will either lead to very decreased mod mood points or
#Death in the hiking scene where she doesn't trust you and falls off a cliff

label ffg_common:
    #Literally the most important variable in the entire mod.
