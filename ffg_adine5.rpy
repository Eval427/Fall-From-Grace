    As "I didn't realize it would come to this. I just executed her plan as she would have. I can understand her reasoning for it, though."
    As "It presents an extraordinary risk. Eliminating these coordinates also eliminates the possibility of Reza getting away through the portal and taking the generator we need with him."
    c "Why not just tie them to my biometric data like the coordinates we need to travel back in time?"

    As "Can we really take that risk? You know that if we fail badly enough even once - if the portal gets destroyed, or if both the Administrator and you die - there won't be any more chances."

    As "I wish I could be done with this already and settle down, but someone has to go back and ensure we can reach the outcome both of us want. No matter if it's you or me, one of us has to do it."
    As "Otherwise, all those we know back home, they... I don't think I need to tell you."
    c "Why are you making me think of those who suffer?"
    As "You'll never forget them, and if you don't do this, it will haunt you. I know."
    c "What do you want me to do? Go back in time and do it all over again?"
    As "It's what we've been trying to do all this time, you know. No compromise."
    c "And of course you want me to do it so you can stay here, huh?"
    As "I will do it myself if that's what it takes. I just hoped it wouldn't have to be me."
    c "Don't we both?"
    As "If we wanted to settle for an outcome where we just stop the comet and stay here, we could have done so a long time ago."
    c "That doesn't mean that we're both not tired of this."
